# Print Partner readiness

Readiness work is tracked in Linear under [GRE-1067](https://linear.app/greetz/issue/GRE-1067), one sub-issue per group of criteria. The baseline is Factory readiness report `f29b55f1-7038-4694-98b0-153675cdcb15`: 59.3%, Level 3, on main `6448fb2f`.

## Pick up a sub-issue

1. Read the sub-issue and the root [agent guide](../../../AGENTS.md). Start from current `main` in a new worktree.
2. Split the work into PRs of about 600 lines or fewer. Open the next PR only after the previous one has Droid review and green CI.
3. Use existing tools first: ESLint, Knip, Clippy, `scripts/local-ci.py`, and the verification helpers. Add a new tool only when nothing in the repo covers the criterion.
4. Prove each check with a negative control: show it fails on a bad input before you rely on it passing.

## Honest scoring

- Every audit counts all five current apps: `web/apps/server`, `web/apps/web`, `rust/crates/pp-server`, `rust/crates/pp-desktop`, and `slicer-sidecar`. Don't drop one to raise the score.
- Don't add features only to satisfy a criterion: no analytics, dummy schemas, empty health endpoints, or default-on telemetry.
- When a criterion conflicts with a product rule, record it as not applicable with the reason in the sub-issue, and get Chad's sign-off.
- Compiling, test collection, and skipped steps are not passing tests. Report executed counts.

## Re-run the audit

Run a full readiness audit only on a clean checkout of a named commit. Store the report, then update GRE-1067 with the new score and the criteria that changed.
