//! Filament grams per Printer Checkoff link (GRE-1165).
//!
//! A link is one send of a file to a printer, and its Checkoff units are the
//! units that send prints. Its grams cover all of those units. The send path
//! records the slicer's estimate when the upload lands ([`record_estimate`]),
//! with the slicer's grams per millimetre of filament when the file states
//! both. When the print finishes, the status watcher records the length the
//! printer measured ([`record_measured`]), and that length times the stored
//! grams per millimetre replaces the estimate, as the owner decided on
//! 2026-11-04. The table is Rust-only and installed by schema step
//! [`SCHEMA_STEP`]; Node never writes it.
//!
//! The Spoolman shortfall reader (`read_model::stock`) spreads a link's grams
//! evenly over its `units` and gives each Part the grams of the units checked
//! off for it under that link.
