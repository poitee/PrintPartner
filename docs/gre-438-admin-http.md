# GRE-438: legal documents and custom filaments over HTTP

With the default-off `desktop_rebuild` feature compiled, `pp_api::admin`
mounts these `GET` and `HEAD` routes at `/` and `/api/v1`, where Node
registers its core routes, only when stored `PP_DESKTOP_REBUILD` is exactly `1`
or `true`. `pp_core::rebuild_api::read_router` mounts them beside the
Accepted Plan reads, from the same `WriterOwner`.

| Route | Body |
| --- | --- |
| `/legal/summary` | `LICENSE-SUMMARY.md` |
| `/legal/license` | `LICENSE` |
| `/legal/attribution` | `ATTRIBUTION.md` |
| `/legal/third-party` | `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` |
| `/filaments/custom` | `{filaments}` read from `<data>/custom_filaments.json` |

Legal documents are compiled in from `web/apps/server/src/data/legal`. The
Node build copies that directory to `dist/data/legal` and requires every file,
and `legal.ts` reads that copy first, so Node never reaches its other
candidates or its 404.

Each request first proves its credential with an empty `ReadClient` batch, so
a missing or wrong credential answers `401` `Authentication required` and a
full queue answers `503`, as on the Accepted Plan routes.

`/filaments/custom` reads the store as `services/custom-filaments.ts::loadStore`
does and serializes it as `JSON.stringify` would:

| Store file | Response |
| --- | --- |
| Missing, a directory, unreadable, or text `JSON.parse` rejects (including a byte order mark) | `200` `{"filaments":[]}` |
| A JSON object with `filaments` | `200` `{"filaments":<value>}`, re-serialized with JavaScript number, string and key-order rules |
| Any other JSON value, or an object without `filaments` | `200` `{}` |
| The literal `null` | `500` with Fastify's `TypeError` body |

Rust only reads the file. Node keeps writing it (`POST` and `DELETE`
`/filaments/custom` stay on Node), so the `custom-filaments` live format still
declares `rust_writes: "none"`.

One known difference: Rust's JSON parser stops at 128 levels of nesting and
then treats the store as unparsable (`{"filaments":[]}`), while Node serves
the nested value. Node writes flat entries, so only a hand-edited store nests
that deep. `ticket_t_62_admin_http` pins this case.

```sh
cargo nextest run --locked --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml -p pp-api -p pp-storage -p pp-core \
  --features pp-api/desktop_rebuild,pp-storage/desktop_rebuild,pp-core/desktop_rebuild \
  --no-tests=fail -E 'test(ticket_t_62_admin) | binary(rebuild_read_http)'
```
