# Print Partner documentation

Use this index to find the guide for your task. The in-app Help page covers the product workflow.

Print Partner is moving its backend from Node to one Rust core. The core runs as a desktop app and as a single-user Docker image. [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) describes the target and the current state.

## Start here

| Guide | Use it when |
|-------|-------------|
| [Install](INSTALL.md) | You are setting up the Docker container or opening Print Partner on a LAN. |
| [Operations](../OPERATIONS.md) | You need backups, recovery, API keys, metrics, logs, or update steps. |
| [MCP setup](assistant-mcp.md) | You want to connect Cursor, Claude, or another MCP client. |
| [Contributing](development/contributing.md) | You want to pick up a ticket and open a pull request. |

## Product workflow

| Area | Browser path | Task |
|------|--------------|------|
| Library | `/library` | Register and sync shared source repositories. |
| Builds | `/builds` | Create, open, copy, archive, or restore a build. |
| Sources | `/sources?profile=<id>` | Attach sources and select STL files for the active build. |
| Plan | `/plan?profile=<id>` | Choose parts, quantities, and colors. Changes save automatically. |
| Checkoff | `/progress?profile=<id>` | Track required units through printing and assembly. |
| Production | `/export?profile=<id>` | Arrange plates, export files, and send sliced jobs. |
| Production overview | `/production` | Review remaining work across builds. |

## Rust core

| Page | Covers |
|------|--------|
| [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) | Target design, current state, and the crate map. |
| [Storage](storage.md) | Data directory, single-writer lock, and migrations. |
| [HTTP API](API.md) | The versioned integration API. |
| [MCP](mcp.md) | The MCP server in the Rust core. |
| [Network sharing](network-sharing.md) | "Share on network" in the desktop app. |
| [Desktop app](desktop.md) | The Tauri app, its tray, and its data. |
| [Docker image](docker.md) | The single-user headless image. |
| [Release](release.md) | How releases are built, signed, and published. |
| [Domain](domain/README.md) | The core model and one page per product area. |
| [Desktop rebuild flag and slice plan](desktop-rebuild.md) | The `desktop_rebuild` feature and the GRE-595 slices. |
| [Single-process guarantees](architecture/background-work-guarantees.md) | What one server process guarantees for the send queue and backup restore. |

## Node server

These pages describe the Node server that the Rust core replaces. Its multi-user, hosted planning, and Postgres modes do not carry over to the Rust core.
