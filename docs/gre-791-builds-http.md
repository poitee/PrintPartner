# GRE-791: gated Plan list and detail reads

With the default-off `desktop_rebuild` feature compiled, `GET` and `HEAD`
`/plans` and `/plans/{id}` mount at the root, `/api/v1`, and `/api/v2` only when
the stored `PP_DESKTOP_REBUILD` value is exactly `1` or `true`. Otherwise those
routes answer 404 and do not open the build graph. Create and delete are
documented in `docs/gre-792-builds-http.md`. Layer list and touch are
`docs/gre-793-builds-http.md`. `GET`/`HEAD` kit-manifest ReadKit is GRE-801
(`docs/gre-801-manifest-http.md`); SaveKit `PUT` is GRE-802
(`docs/gre-802-manifest-http.md`). Layer mutate is `docs/gre-794-builds-http.md`.
Jobs and ReadBuilder stay unregistered (later D25 children). The desktop
gateway does not mount this router in this slice.

Admission (loopback Host/Origin, principal, forwarded-header refusal) is shared
with drafts through the crate-private `loopback` module.

List responses are `{ "profiles": [ <ProfileSummary>, ... ] }`. Detail
responses are a bare `ProfileSummary` (`id`, `name`, `order_number`,
`special_request`, `part_count`, `accepted_progress`, `build_stale`,
`freshness`, `archived_at`, `last_used_at`). Missing or cross-tenant ids answer
404 with `"Profile not found"`. Unauthenticated requests answer 401 with
`"Authentication required"`. HEAD shares status and auth with GET and returns
an empty body.

`freshness.status: "unavailable"` with a `code` (for example `accepted_inputs`)
is an integrity failure while evaluating freshness. It is not rewritten as
`untracked` / `no_accepted_inputs`.

The session cookie or one API key selects the tenant. API keys use the
configured tenant, not a request header.
