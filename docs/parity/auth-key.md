# API-key HTTP parity

The [auth-key fixture](../../fixtures/parity/auth-key/README.md) compares the complete Node and Rust response bodies for disposable API keys in the default and `desktop_rebuild` auth clients. It covers revocation, regeneration, stored expiry, and tenant isolation.

Unknown and foreign key IDs return HTTP 404 with `{"detail":"API key not found","title":"Not Found","status":404}`. Only that status and detail pair receives these problem fields. Other auth failure bodies retain their existing contracts.

Run the fixture's check commands in both feature modes when changing API-key response serialization. The fixture guide documents normalization, secret-redaction controls, and regeneration.
