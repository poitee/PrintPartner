# Contributing

This page describes how work moves from a ticket to a merged pull request. [Building](building.md) covers the local toolchain.

## Sources of truth

- **Goals and decisions.** The Notion page "Goals and decisions (2026-10-15)" under Print Partner Roadmap. Where an older document disagrees, that page wins.
- **Execution.** The Linear project "Print Partner Desktop (Rust core)". Milestones 1 to 9 are the delivery chunks. The desktop rebuild slices (D-slices) are sub-issues of GRE-595.
- **Code and evidence.** The `main` branch of `poitee/PrintPartner`.

## Pick a ticket

1. Take the highest-priority unblocked ticket in the lowest-numbered milestone.
2. Check the ticket's blocking relations in Linear before you start.
3. Move the ticket to In Progress.

Open one PR per ticket. If you find work that belongs to another ticket, add a comment to that ticket instead of changing it in your PR.

## Keep rebuild code behind the flag

New Rust rebuild code compiles only with the `desktop_rebuild` Cargo feature, which is off by default. Code that a user can see also checks the `PP_DESKTOP_REBUILD` environment variable. Do not turn `desktop_rebuild` on by default; that is the maintainer's decision. [Desktop rebuild flag](../desktop-rebuild.md) describes the flag and the slice plan.

## TypeScript naming

The web ESLint config enforces `camelCase` for ordinary identifiers, `PascalCase` for types, and `UPPER_CASE` for constants. Property names, imports, and destructured names are exempt so contract, JSON, SQLite, and third-party field names stay unchanged. Generated `*.generated.ts` files are exempt; fix their names in the generator instead. `web/eslint-suppressions.json` tracks existing violations in the legacy Node server. Remove entries as those names are corrected; do not increase the baseline to hide new violations.

## Complexity limits

The web ESLint config limits `complexity` to 20, nesting depth to 5 and parameters to 5 in every TypeScript and JavaScript file. Existing violations are recorded in `web/eslint-suppressions.json` with the naming violations, as a count per file and rule. A new violation, or one more in a file that already has some, fails `npm run lint`. When you simplify code, run `npx eslint . --prune-suppressions` from `web/` and commit the lower counts. Function and file length limits come after the Prettier rollout, because reformatting changes line counts.

## Open the pull request

1. Meet the [definition of done](definition-of-done.md).
2. Run `just ci` and fix every failure before you push. [Gate evidence](../contributing/gate-evidence.md#run-ci-locally-before-you-push) describes the command.
3. Fill in every section of the [pull request template](../../.github/pull_request_template.md). Put verification output under `## Evidence`.
4. Start the PR description with `Refs GRE-xxx` for a partial slice or `Fixes GRE-xxx` for the PR that completes the ticket.
5. Move the ticket to In Review only when the PR is ready for review. If the PR is blocked or escalated, keep the ticket In Progress and add a comment.

## After the merge

- Add a comment to the ticket that says what landed and what remains.
- Do not mark a parent ticket Done because one child merged.

## Changes that need the maintainer

Prepare the files and ask the maintainer for changes to:

- GitHub repository settings and branch protection.
- Releases and deployments.
- The production instance.
