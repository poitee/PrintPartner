# Desktop rebuild flag

GRE-596 adds a build gate and a runtime opt-in for the desktop rebuild in GRE-595. Both default to off.

The `desktop_rebuild` Cargo feature is available on `pp-core`, `pp-contracts`, `pp-domain`, `pp-storage`, and `pp-desktop`. The desktop feature enables the core feature. The contracts feature exposes the new `build_identity`, `reconciliation`, `publication`, and `working_drafts` modules. Existing autosave contracts stay available in both builds.

GRE-498 adds the `pp-domain::features` registry and `pp-storage::features` tenant and Plan overrides behind `desktop_rebuild`. The storage client requires an explicit `AuthPolicy`. User choices are account preferences under the current one-account-per-tenant model. `SingleAccountDefault` maps sessions to the `default` tenant. When `PP_DESKTOP_REBUILD` is exactly `1` or `true`, Node enforces the tenant-global `farm` choice for printer queue suggestions and `get_farm_status` through MCP and the assistant. These operations default to disabled and ignore Plan overrides. Other Node operations do not enforce these toggles.

With `desktop_rebuild`, Rust library callers can open storage with `WriterOwner::open_with_job_feature_admission(directory, limits)`. Every worker from that owner checks `Feature::Spoolman` before admitting a new `SpoolmanDeduction`. Ordinary `open` and `open_at` retain legacy behavior. Repeat the opted-in constructor on each reopen. Storage reads no runtime environment flag.

Admission resolves the stored job tenant and `PrinterUpload.profile_id` through the existing feature API's owned `build_profiles` Plan. Plan choices override user choices, then default to false. Missing or foreign Plans and corrupt settings return errors. Disabled admission returns typed `JobFailure::FeatureDisabled` before changing the job or renewing its lease. Existing effects can still be confirmed or reconciled after a disable. `Finish(None)` still requires primary printer receipts. This is Rust library enforcement only. No production Spoolman driver or desktop bootstrap wiring is added.

`CoreRuntime::start` reads `PP_DESKTOP_REBUILD` once at startup and stores the effective setting. `CoreRuntime::desktop_rebuild().enabled()` returns that setting. Only the exact values `1` and `true` enable it, and only when `pp-core` was compiled with `desktop_rebuild`. Missing, non-Unicode, empty, false, and unrecognized values produce false. The setting is process-local and does not change `desktop.toml` or persisted data.

D1 adds no routes, storage migrations, UI, or rebuild execution. The existing gateway and Node compatibility runtime continue to run even when both gates are enabled. Future rebuild behavior must check the stored runtime setting and compile behind the Cargo feature.

Build the native shell with the core gate enabled using its existing staging prerequisites:

```sh
PP_DESKTOP_REBUILD=true cargo run --locked --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml -p pp-desktop --features desktop_rebuild
```

The contracts and core gates can be tested without a native shell:

```sh
cargo test --locked --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml -p pp-contracts
cargo test --locked --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml -p pp-contracts --features desktop_rebuild
cargo test --locked --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml -p pp-core --lib
cargo test --locked --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml -p pp-core --lib --features desktop_rebuild
```

Core tests isolate environment changes in child processes. They cover absent, disabled, invalid, and enabled values with and without the Cargo feature. The existing autosave consumer tests run in both contract builds. The Rust runtime proof checks the existing authenticated endpoints, source creation, response shapes, and shutdown with the runtime opt-in absent or false.

## Slice plan

The rebuild ships as small PRs to `main`, each under about 1.5k lines and checkable on its own. Every code slice compiles behind the `desktop_rebuild` Cargo feature, and anything user-visible also checks the runtime setting (D31 and D32 are exceptions; see below). The default build stays unchanged. The old desktop stack (#135 to #168, `desktop/rust-core`, and the reference branch `desktop/source-sync-local-current-20261008`) is reference only. It is not merged, and it is not closed or deleted until the slices cover it.

Each slice is done when:

- the existing suites pass with the feature off and on, and the default build is unchanged;
- a reviewer engine other than the author's scores it above 8 on the exact head, with all checks green.

Slices land in this order. Linear tracks each one under GRE-595. A slice is one Linear item and may ship as several PRs (D16 is planned as three). Some modules already exist on main from earlier PRs (for example #129 to #131); a slice ports only the delta from the reference branch.

Gap slices added in triage on 2026-10-13 cover commits that are not in the reference branch. The flag rule applies to D27 to D30. D31 is CI-only and D32 is a docs-only audit, so neither needs the flag.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D27 | GRE-622 | Plate layout and STL geometry parity (#161) | D10 |
| D28 | GRE-623 | ZIP acquisition label policy and bundle-probe SQLite lifetime (#149) | D4 |
| D29 | GRE-624 | Failed-Save intent retry and draft lifecycle replay (#145, #148) | D13 |
| D30 | GRE-625 | Source catalog metadata through Rust HTTP (#144) | D8, D23 |
| D31 | GRE-626 | Reconcile CI ratchet commits from #155 with main | D1 |
| D32 | GRE-627 | Coverage audit mapping #133 and #135 patches to slices | none; runs early, re-checked before cutover |

Turning `desktop_rebuild` on by default is a separate decision for the maintainer after D26 and D32.

## Directory layout resolver

GRE-344 adds `pp_core::layout` behind the default-off `desktop_rebuild` Cargo feature. `DirectoryLayout::resolve` takes a platform, home path, and `LayoutEnvironment` snapshot. It returns store, auxiliary app data, config, logs, and cache paths without filesystem access. `store` retains `~/.print-partner` outside portable mode, as required by [ADR 0005](adr/0005-desktop-product-identity.md). The existing database and `desktop.toml` belong to `store`. Outside portable mode, `app_data` holds auxiliary state. Portable mode places both `store` and `app_data` in `<root>/data`. Desktop and server launch paths do not call it yet. The desktop continues to reuse `~/.print-partner`, and pp-server continues to require `--data`. No data migration is included.

macOS auxiliary app data and config use `~/Library/Application Support/com.poitee.printpartner`. Logs use `~/Library/Logs/com.poitee.printpartner`, and cache uses `~/Library/Caches/com.poitee.printpartner`.

Linux auxiliary app data uses the `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`, and `XDG_CACHE_HOME` roots. Missing or empty values default to `~/.local/share`, `~/.config`, `~/.local/state`, and `~/.cache`. Each path appends `com.poitee.printpartner`; logs also append `logs` under the state directory. A nonempty relative XDG value returns an error rather than choosing a directory relative to the process working directory.

`LayoutEnvironment::from_env` reads those variables, `APPDATA`, `LOCALAPPDATA`, and `PP_PORTABLE_DIR`. A supplied portable root takes precedence on every platform and appends `data`, `config`, `logs`, and `cache`. An empty portable root returns an error. Selected roots and the home path must be absolute and contain no parent traversal. The resolver preserves non-Unicode paths and does not canonicalize paths or follow links.

Launcher integration with legacy-store preservation, directory permission checks, browser preference capture and restore, and installed artifact receipts remain open. The resolver does not enable any user-visible behavior, so no runtime opt-in is read here. Future launcher integration must check the stored runtime gate.

Windows auxiliary app data and config use `<APPDATA>/com.poitee.printpartner`. Cache uses `<LOCALAPPDATA>/com.poitee.printpartner`; logs append `logs` to that local directory. Missing or empty variables fall back independently to `~/AppData/Roaming` and `~/AppData/Local`. Nonempty relative or parent-traversing values return a named error. The legacy store remains `~/.print-partner`. Windows ignores XDG values; macOS and Linux ignore Windows values.

These are pure path mappings using the host's `Path` semantics. The Linux tests supply absolute Linux paths to exercise the Windows mapping policy. They do not parse Windows drive or UNC paths on Linux, resolve Windows Known Folders, or establish a Windows build or launcher receipt. Rust entry points still contain Unix-specific APIs.

Portable path tests run on Linux, including the macOS and Windows mappings:

```sh
cargo nextest run --locked --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml -p pp-core --lib --features desktop_rebuild --no-tests=fail -E 'test(layout::tests::ticket_t_12)'
```

### Origin recovery and library preferences

CoreRuntime replaces a valid saved port only when binding returns `AddrInUse`. It holds the replacement listener while publishing a private same-directory file, syncing the file, checking the old file identity and content, renaming, and syncing the directory. Node starts only after publication succeeds. Missing configuration retains hard-link publication without clobbering an existing name. Corrupt and unsafe configuration still fails closed. `origin_change()` returns an optional immutable `OriginChange::PersistedPortInUse` with nonzero old and new ports. Its display notice contains no launch token or credentials.

`CoreHandle` offers typed per-field updates and reads for `BrowserPreferences` under the existing storage lease. The versioned `browser-preferences.json` sidecar is independent of the port. It stores optional sidebar collapse, theme, and supported printer poll interval values. Unknown fields, invalid values, unsupported versions, unsafe files, and oversized files fail without overwrite. Updates preserve other fields and unrelated portable-store bytes. Shutdown closes command admission and settles queued callers before releasing the lease.

This is a library contract. GRE-368 must wire browser capture and restore and show the origin-change notice. Existing origin-scoped localStorage and IndexedDB do not follow a changed port today. These operations do not relocate or rewrite product databases or transfer authentication data. A new runtime always bootstraps its gateway session, without adding a user login flow.

## Review observations

GRE-598 adds `pp_core::review_observations` behind `desktop_rebuild`. Library callers can observe an accepted storage snapshot for available input roots, missing STL artifacts, and accepted thumbnail signatures. Reads share entry, path, byte, and elapsed budgets and support cancellation. Source inventory reads use pinned directory handles. The small `pp-source::observation` helper is gated by the source crate's new feature, enabled by the core feature.

An optional filament provider reads bounded JSON over HTTP, confines redirects to its original origin, and resolves only its configured integration's filament identifiers. Provider reads reuse the checked `pp-net` address policy and pin DNS answers before connecting. Cloud metadata destinations are rejected. Provider failures fall back to catalog-only lookup. Cancellation returns an error. No application routes or startup paths call these library methods, so runtime behavior remains unchanged. Later drafts API integration must check the stored `PP_DESKTOP_REBUILD` setting.

The second D3 PR remains dependent on later source and storage work. The reference acquisition and upload modules require retained capture from D5, the upload journal from D14, and import job methods from D15. Those APIs are absent on main. This port does not claim acquisition or upload completion and does not advance those slices.
